<p>Nothing matters but empathy, compassion and kindness. Empathy is the understanding of another that drives the desire to be compassionate that drives the act of kindness.</p>
  
<p>I spent years as a religionist, trying to understand the good life. It always eluded me because religion will not bring the good life. Religion is a framework for the exercise of power and power is the antithesis of kindness.</p>

<p>If we are to live well, we must emphasize kindness, for there is nothing else that brings greatness of spirit or existence. We will all become ash and the best we can do is leave behind kindness. Without it, our species is doomed.</p>

<p>The Buddha was right that all is suffering. He was wrong that the suffering is external. Suffering is not illness, aging and death. Suffering is the mental states that we create for ourselves and the suffering that we project onto others through our actions. External acts cannot bring suffering. It is created in the mind.</p>

<p>Do you want to live the good life? Do you want to be spiritual? Practice kindness towards all. Do no harm</p>

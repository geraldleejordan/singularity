<h2>Influences on Narrative Therapy</h2>

Narrative Therapy grew out of a number of disciplines in addition to mental health therapeutic models. These include literary and anthropological disciplines. The founders of Narrative Therapy, Michael White and David Epston had wide interests and brought differing ideas into their social and family therapy practices. A discussion of these influences would take volumes, but notable influences were Michel Foucault - the French philosopher, or as he liked to refer to himself, a “historian of ideas” - and - to be discussing in the “Re-membering” chapter to come - the anthropologist Barbara Myerhoff. These influences continue to evolve within the therapeutic context.

<h2>Narrative Therapy</h2>

Narrative Therapy proposes that we live our lives within stories, both stories that we tell ourselves and stories imposed upon us by others. Most of these stories go unquestioned. Within NT we begin to examine and question the stories of our lives, considering what other less emphasized or neglected stories might exist. As we discover our alternate stories, we can begin to build our lives in new preferred ways.

<h2>Dominant Narratives</h2>

Our parents tell us stories about ourselves. Our cultures have shared stories. We are born into stories. We accept most of these. When new events occur, we seek - individually and collectively - to fit these into the frameworks of the stories we have already accepted. Few seriously challenge the stories of their lives.

<h2>Alternate Narratives</h2>

Sometimes, events take place - physical, mental or otherwise - which do not fit with the dominant narratives of our lives. Most will disregard these exceptions. Within Narrative Therapy, we look for these exceptions to consider whether they provide alternate stories for our lives.

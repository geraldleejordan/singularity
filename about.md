## Gerald Lee Jordan

I got pulled into religion at eight years of age. At nine, I walked forward at church camp, claiming that I would be a missionary. At eighteen, I began religious studies at university, being true to that nine year old. 

I spent almost five years at university, studying theology and history. I completed my degree in 1990. I became a free-thinker (atheist) in 1992. Between 1992 and 2014, I wandered in the wilderness. In 2014, I became a vegetarian and then I became vegan in 2018. I have never returned to religion, but spirituality came to me when I stopped abusing and murdering other beings.

This book is my path to the spirituality of kindness. It is really all so simple, we have just made life difficult. Let's find that path from the wilderness together!
